How to list all the (Q,W)-descriptions:

variable 1: 	a (Q,W)-description
variable 2:	the lower bound of (the next entry in W, the next entry in Q)
output:		a list of all the descriptions

variable 1 initiallized to the constant (Q,W)-description
variable 2 initiallized to (the minimum of W, -1)

while variable 1 is not None:
	if variable 2 is not None and variable 1 can be extended so that the next entry is >= variable 2:
		variable 1 is extended by appending variable 2 to the end
		variable 2 is set to the successor of the smallest available single-step extension (if exists, None otherwise)
		loop
	otherwise:
		add variable 1 to the end of output
		variable 2 is set to the successor of the last entry of variable 1 (if exists, None otherwise)
		variable 1 shortened by 1
		loop
