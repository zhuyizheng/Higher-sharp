How to list all the (Q,W)-descriptions:

	pointer 1:		enumerate all the nodes in dom*(Q)
	
	pointer 2:		enumerate a node in the level-1 tree component of pointer 1, in the order provided by pointer 1 
	
	variable 1:		constructing a level-1 tree factoring map, in the order provided by pointer 2
		
		if pointer 2 can be assigned a node that keeps the order, proceed. 
		otherwise, move back
	
	variable 2: 	when variable 1 has finished constructing, put it into variable 2, and pointer 2 moves one bit forward
	
		the structure of variable 2: 	
		
		indexed by a level-1 tree. as soon as variable 1 finishes constructing, add a node in this level-1 tree
		
		(create a class Level_21_DescriptionTreeBlock inherited from a LevelOneTreeBlock, and a class Level_21_DescriptionTree)
		


How to list all the (T,Q,W)-descirpions:

	pointer 1:		enumerate all the nodes in dom*(Q)
	
	pointer 2:		enumerate a node in the level-1 tree component of pointer 1, in the order provided by pointer 1 

	variable 1: 	constructing a level-(1,2,1) tree factoring map, in the order provided by pointer 2
	
		if pointer 2 can be assigned a node that keeps the (2,1)-description level-1-order, proceed. 
				recursive: 	need to enumerate all the (new) (2,1)-descriptions
				
		otherwise, move back
		
	variable 2: 	when variable 1 has finished constructing, put it into variable 2, and pointer 2 moves one bit forward

		the structure of variable 2:
		
		(level-1 component, level-2 component)
		indexed by a level-1 tree and a level-2 tree
		
		(create a class Level_221_DescriptionTreeBlock inherited from a LevelOneTreeBlock, and a class Level_221_DescriptionTree)
