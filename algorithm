How to list all the (Q,W)-descriptions:

current: 	a (Q,W)-description
bound:		the lower bound of the next length-1 extension of current
output:		a list of all the descriptions

current initiallized to the constant (Q,W)-description
bound initiallized to (the minimum of W, -1)

while current is not None:
	if bound is not None:
		current is extended by appending bound to the end
		bound is set to the successor of the smallest available single-step extension (if exists, None otherwise)
		loop
	otherwise:
		add current to the end of output
		bound is set to the successor of the last entry of current (if exists, None otherwise)
		current shortened by 1, (if possible, None if current has length 0)
		loop
