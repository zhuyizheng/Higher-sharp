How to list all the (Q,W)-descriptions:

current: 	a (Q,W)-description
bound:		the lower bound of the next length-1 extension of current
output:		a list of all the descriptions

current initiallized to the constant (Q,W)-description
bound initiallized to (the minimum of W, -1)

while current is not None:
	if bound is not None:
		current is set to bound
		bound is set to the successor of the smallest available single-step extension (if exists, None otherwise)
		loop
	otherwise:
		add current to the end of output
		bound is set to the successor of the last entry of current (if exists, None otherwise)
		current shortened by 1, (if possible, None if current has length 0)
		loop

How to list all the (T,Q)-descriptions:

X:		a level-2 tree
psi:		a map factoring (X,T,Q)
depth:		how far are we in
marker:		if we have added anything new at prev level

X initialized to a level <=2 tree isomorphis to (T,Q1ï¼‰-descriptions: X1 to nonconstant desc, X2 is trivial, to the constant desc
psi initiallized to the canonical map factoring (X,T,Q)
depth initialized to 0
marker initialized to True

while marker is True:
	marker set to False
	for x in X2 whose length is "depth":
		Function: "Add all the possible extensions of (X,psi,T,Q) at x"
		if something is added, marker set to True
