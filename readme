Compute the combinatorics in my paper

compiles with gcc 4.8.4 with c++11 option

There is a tiny bug with inputting a level-2 or level-3 tree. If the domain has ((0)),((0,0)),((0,1)),((0,0,0)),((1)),((0,1),(0)) the program automatically renames them to ((3)),((1)),((2)),((0)),((4)),((2),(0)). As far as isomorphism type concerned, I don't care.
